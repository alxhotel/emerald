## About
Hi, I am Alex. The purpose of this blog is to document the development process of my Degree's Final Project at URJC (Universidad Rey Juan Carlos).

PeerClass is a virtual classroom webapp. The purpose of PeerClass is to make easier teaching to multiple students through the web.

You can follow the development of PeerClass at this [repository on Github](https://github.com/alxhotel/peerclass/).

Enjoy!
